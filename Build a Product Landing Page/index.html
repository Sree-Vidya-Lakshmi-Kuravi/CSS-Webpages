Build a Product Landing Page
---------------------------------
Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
You should have an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img" (A logo would make a good image here).
Within the #header element, you should have a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
You should have at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.
When you click a .nav-link button in the nav element, you should be taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
You should have an embedded product video with id="video".
Your landing page should have a form element with a corresponding id="form".
Within the form, there should be an input field with id="email" where you can enter an email address.
The #email input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for.
The #email input field should use HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
Within the form, there should be a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
When you click the #submit element, the email should be submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.org/email-submit).
The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
Your product landing page should have at least one media query.
Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
Note: Be sure to link your stylesheet in your HTML and apply your CSS.
