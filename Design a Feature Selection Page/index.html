Design a Feature Selection Page
------------------------------------
Your page should have an h1 element with the text Feature Selection.
Your page should have a div element with the class feature-card-container.
Your page should have at least two label elements each with the class feature-card inside the div.
Each of your label elements should each have label text and an input element of type checkbox in them.
Create a selector that targets the checkboxes, and apply the following styling:
All of your checkbox elements should be set to appearance: none; in your CSS.
All of your checkbox elements should have a border width, color and style of your choosing.
When the checkbox is checked, it should display a checkmark ✓ in the center of the checkbox.
When the checkbox is checked, the background color of the checkbox should change to a color of your choosing.
When the checkbox is checked, the border color of the checkbox should change to a color of your choosing.
